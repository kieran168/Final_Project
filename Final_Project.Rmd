# Possible Hypotheses
What is the impact of consumerism on a person/household's personal finances?

What is the impact of consumerism on debt?

How does a course in personal finance in high school impact a person's finances in the long-term? short-term?

How much more income is earned by someone who has taken a personal finance course in high school? In college? after graduating from college?

How much more money is spent by people who use credit cards more often on a daily basis versus people who use paper cash more often on a daily basis?

Someone with great financial knowledge should have the understanding and foresight to save for the future/emergency fund.
*Make emergency fund the dependent variable and use the objective questions as independent variables. I would expect to see that those with correct answers in the objective questions should have an emergency fund*

What type of people will have an emergency fund?


# Introduction


# Literature Review

## Article #1
Jaclyn J. Beierlein, Margot Neverett, (2013). "Who takes personal finance?", http://ccny-proxy1.libr.ccny.cuny.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=bth&AN=94644713&site=ehost-live

This article has certainly peaked my interests because I always believed that if people took a course in personal finance that they would make much smarter decisions with their money.

### Data
Institutional data from admission applications and transcripts of 17,499 students at East Carolina University. I believe this type of data should be accessible by asking for it from a college or university if they can provide it to me anonymized.

### Econometric Techniques
They made dummy variables (0/1) of all the variables they have and ran a t-test to determine the difference between the group who took the personal finance course and those who did not. They also performed a logistic regression to account for spurious relationships amongst the variables. Used ordinal regression to analyze students' grades.

### What question is addressed?
This articles primary question is: What are the characteristics of traditional undergraduate students that take the university personal finance class?

### Findings
Assuming that enrollment in a personal finance course is considered showing as a measure of interest, women demonstrate less interest in personal finance than do men. Those with highest interest in a pesonal finance course are: men, business, human ecology an social science majors. Those students who are less likely to take a personal finance course are: women, students with higher verbal SAT scores and GPAs, and arts and education majors.


## Article #2
Hancock, Adam M.; Jorgensen, Bryce L.; Swanson, Melvin S., (2013). "College Students and Credit Card Use: The Role of Parents, Work Experience, Financial Knowledge, and Credit Card Attitudes", http://ccny-proxy1.libr.ccny.cuny.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ecn&AN=1412539&site=ehost-live

### Data
The data they used were from the College Student Financial Literacy Surveys (CSFLS), which measures the financial knowledge, attitudes, behavior, influences, and personal demographics that may affect the fianncial literacy of college students.

### Econometric Techniques
Logistical regression to predict likelihood of having two or more credit cards. Logistical regression predicting likelihood of having more than $500 in credit card debt

### What question is addressed?
This study is trying to examine how students' credit card behaviors (i.e. number of credit cards and amount of debt) is influenced by: parental interactions, years of work experience, financial knowledge, credit card attitudes, and personal characteristics.

### Data
2015 National Financial Capability Study (NFCS) State-by-State Survey Instrument sponsored by the Financial Industry Regulation Authority (FINRA)

### Econometric Techniques
Ordered logistic regressions were run to analyze the key dependent variables (when the dependent variable was an index of behaviors; either 0-3 or 0-4). 

Logistic Regression was used for when the dependent variable was the short-term variable budgeting.

### What question is addressed?
Examine the influence of financial literacy and financial education on the long- and short-term financial behaviors, by age group for those without a college degree.

### Findings
The study found that confidence in both financial knowledge and financial ability are important influences on positive financial behaviors for those without a college degree.

### Data
2012 National Financial Capability Study (NFCS) State-by-State Survey Instrument sponsored by the Financial Industry Regulation Authority (FINRA)

### Econometric Techniques
Ordered logistic regressions were run to analyze the key dependent variables (when the dependent variable was an index of behaviors; either 0-3 or 0-4). The Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) test was run to check for multicollinearity between the independent variables used in this study. The VIF test indicated no multicollinearity. Dependent variables were both long-term and short-term financial behaviors.

### What question is addressed?
Examine the influence of financial literacy and financial education on the long- and short-term financial behaviors, among various age groups (18-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, 65+).

### Findings
The study found that both objective and subjective financial literacy were positively associated with long- and short-term financial behaviors. 

In the younger age groups subjective financial knowledge had a stronger correlation than either objective financial knowledge or subjective financial management ability. This means that confidence in one's financial literacy mattered more when it came to making the right financial decisions than actual objective knowledge of the financial topic.

In the older age groups, objective financial knowledge was more strongly related to long-term financial behavior than either of the other two measures of financial literacy.This means the older age groups, objective financial knowledge translated to financial smarter decisions with their money than simply confidence in one's own self.

A higher financial well-being reduced the odds of pawnshop use by 17%, even after controlling for having a bank account, having a credit card, being financially overconfident, proximity to local pawnshops, and selected demographic characteristics

### Data

### Econometric Techniques


### What question is addressed?
Why Do Households Lack Emergency Savings? The Role of Financial Capability

### Findings
Subjective financial knowledge, financial confidence, and savings account ownership, but not objective financial knowledge, were significant and consistent predictors of having an emergency fund. Savings account ownership was the strongest predictor, accounting for an increase in the probability of having an emergency fund of 25% to 29% across study years. Adding homeownership and ability to cover expenses to the models increased the proportion of variance explained by an average of 29%.
